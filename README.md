# Natural Language to SQL Translation using Open-Source LLMs

This project is part of my undergraduate thesis for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## üìå Overview

The goal is to explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to automatically translate natural language questions into SQL queries, making database interaction more accessible to non-technical users.

We focus on using **open-source LLMs** that can run on modest hardware, providing a cost-effective alternative to proprietary solutions.

## üß† Core Ideas

- Evaluate and compare open-source LLMs for the Text-to-SQL task
- Explore effective prompt engineering techniques
- Address natural language ambiguities and complex database schemas
- Utilize methods like few-shot learning, self-consistency, and intermediate representations
- Benchmark with standard datasets such as [**Spider**](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider)

## üîß Tools & Techniques

- Prompt tuning and context injection
- Query evaluation based on accuracy and recall
- Experiments with lightweight, locally deployable models

## üìÖ Timeline

Development started in **November 2024** and is expected to conclude by **June 2025**.
