# Natural Language to SQL Translation using Open-Source LLMs

This project is part of my undergraduate thesis for a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

## 📌 Overview

The goal is to explore how large language models (LLMs) can be used to automatically translate natural language questions into SQL queries, making database interaction more accessible to non-technical users.

We focus on using **open-source LLMs** that can run on modest hardware, providing a cost-effective alternative to proprietary solutions.

## 🧠 Core Ideas

- Evaluate and compare open-source LLMs for the Text-to-SQL task
- Explore effective prompt engineering techniques
- Address natural language ambiguities and complex database schemas
- Utilize methods like few-shot learning, self-consistency, and intermediate representations
- Benchmark with standard datasets such as [**Spider**](https://yale-lily.github.io/spider)

## 🔧 Tools & Techniques

- Prompt tuning and context injection
- Query evaluation based on accuracy and recall
- Experiments with lightweight, locally deployable models

## 📅 Timeline

Development started in **November 2024** and is expected to conclude by **June 2025**.
